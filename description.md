### Description

* In order to accurately follow the remote anchor carried by (person), the UAV system will carry out a series of algorithms with the use of GPS and bluetooth to follow as precisely as possible. The use of GPS in the system is crucial to determing position and is used in localization, as well as the bearing to the remote anchor. However GPS positional accuracy varies with different conditions so bluetooth will be used in sync to determine position in respect to distance. Bluetooth is used to find the distance by sending information to and from the remote and the UAV and using the time taken to determine approxiamate distance.[BLE_Distance](). In addition to this the remotes onBoard GPS and controller maps the path already taken and relays the information back to the UAV to aid the obstacle avoidance sytem.
